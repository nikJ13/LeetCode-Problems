In this problem, we find the maximum sum subarray, the minimum sum subarray and the sum of all elements in the array. Then compare if the sum of maximum sum subarray is greater than the sum - sum of minimum sum subarray or not. This is done because the array is cyclic in nature. So, subtracting the subarray which makes the smallest sum would leave the remaining elements which makeup as the largest sum. For example:

In case all the elements of the array are negative, then the maximum sum subarray is the answer, which will the single greatest negative number of the array.
